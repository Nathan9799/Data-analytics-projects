Project title; Car fuel efficiency analysis

Problem statement
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze a dataset of car models to uncover insights about fuel efficiency based on various attributes such as car type, number of cylinders, drivetrain type, fuel type, and engine displacement. This analysis aims to help stakeholders (car manufacturers) make informed decisions about vehicle design and fuel efficiency, identifying trends and factors that influence a car's fuel economy.

Key terms in the dataset
Drivetrain Type;
Refers to how power is delivered to the wheels. Types include;

FWD (Front-Wheel Drive): Power goes to the front wheels.
RWD (Rear-Wheel Drive): Power goes to the rear wheels.
AWD (All-Wheel Drive): Power goes to all four wheels.

Cylinders
Indicates the number of cylinders in the engine. More cylinders usually mean more power but lower fuel efficiency.

4 Cylinders: More fuel-efficient.
6 Cylinders: Balanced power and efficiency.
8 Cylinders: More powerful but less fuel-efficient.

Fuel type
Shows the type of fuel the car uses:

Gasoline; Common and widely used.

Diesel; More fuel-efficient, but produces more emissions.

Electric; Runs on electricity, usually more efficient and eco-friendly.

Engine displacement;
The total size of the engine (measured in liters). Larger engines tend to use more fuel.

Fuel efficiency (MPG);
Measures how far a car can go per gallon of fuel. It’s split into;

City MPG; Efficiency in city driving.
Highway MPG; Efficiency on highways.
Combined MPG; Average efficiency for both city and highway driving.

Analysis and findings
1. Average Fuel Efficiency (City, Highway, and Combined MPG)
The objective here was to determine the average fuel efficiency of cars in the dataset.

Findings; The analysis revealed that the average fuel efficiency across all cars in the dataset is as follows;

Average City MPG: 21.46
Average Highway MPG: 28.61
Average Combined MPG: 24.07

These averages provide a baseline for understanding overall fuel efficiency within the company’s fleet. With the average combined MPG at 24.07, the company may want to consider whether there is potential to increase fleet fuel efficiency through model selection or vehicle upgrades, especially as fuel efficiency is becoming an increasingly important factor for both consumers and regulators.

2. Fuel type distribution
THe objective here was to analyze the distribution of fuel types within the company’s fleet and evaluate the prevalence of different fuel types.

Findings; It was observed that gasoline-powered vehicles overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, comprising 99.63% of the fleet. Diesel and electric vehicles accounted for only 0.37% each.

This distribution could suggest that the company’s fleet is predominantly relying on traditional fuel sources, which might not align with future sustainability goals or the growing demand for electric vehicles. As the industry moves toward greener alternatives, the company may need to explore diversification into electric or hybrid vehicles to meet environmental regulations and attract eco-conscious customers.

3. Fuel efficiency by cylinders
The objective here was explore how the number of cylinders in the engine affects fuel efficiency.

Findings; The analysis showed that cars with 4 cylinders exhibited the highest average fuel efficiency across city, highway, and combined MPG. In contrast, vehicles with 6 or more cylinders tend to have lower fuel efficiency.

This finding could influence the company’s vehicle purchasing decisions, particularly when considering cost-saving strategies or environmentally-friendly initiatives. Opting for cars with smaller engines (such as 4-cylinder models) could be a way to improve fleet fuel efficiency without compromising performance, aligning with both cost reduction goals and environmental considerations.

4. Fuel efficiency by Drivetrain type
The objective here was to determine how drivetrain type influences fuel efficiency.

Findings; The analysis highlighted that Front-Wheel Drive (FWD) vehicles had the highest average combined MPG, outperforming All-Wheel Drive (AWD) and Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) vehicles, which generally had lower fuel efficiency.

For the company, this could suggest that prioritizing FWD vehicles for certain uses for example urban or fleet vehicles might lead to fuel savings. This finding could prompt a reassessment of the company’s vehicle types, particularly in light of fuel cost trends and environmental considerations.


5.Fuel efficiency trend over the years
The objective here was to observe how fuel efficiency has changed over time across different years.

Findings; The analysis revealed a slight upward trend in average combined MPG from 2014 to 2024, with a notable peak in 2021 at 26.10 MPG. This indicates that, on average, vehicles in the fleet have become more fuel-efficient over time.

This upward trend suggests that vehicle manufacturers are improving fuel efficiency in response to stricter fuel economy standards and consumer preferences for more eco-friendly cars. For the company, this presents an opportunity to assess the performance of newer vehicles in the fleet and potentially phase out older, less efficient models. The trend also signals that future vehicle acquisitions should prioritize models that continue to improve in fuel efficiency.

6. Engine displacement trend over the years
The objective here was to explore how the average engine displacement has changed over time.

Findings; The average engine displacement has decreased from 3.51L in 2014 to 2.76L in 2024, suggesting a shift toward smaller, more efficient engines.

For the company, this trend could indicate that smaller engines are becoming more prevalent and effective at balancing performance with fuel economy. As the company plans future vehicle acquisitions, this trend suggests that smaller engines should be considered, especially for standard fleet operations where high engine performance may not be a priority.

7. Relationship between cylinders and drivetrain type
The objective here was to analyze the distribution of cars based on their number of cylinders and drivetrain type.

Findings; It was found that 4-cylinder cars are most commonly associated with Front-Wheel Drive (FWD), while 8-cylinder cars are more frequently found in Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) and All-Wheel Drive (AWD) vehicles. This suggests that smaller, more fuel-efficient engines are more often paired with FWD, while larger engines are typically used in more rugged, performance-oriented drivetrain types.

For the company, this insight could guide decisions on optimizing the vehicle fleet for various operational needs. For instance, 4-cylinder FWD vehicles might be ideal for urban and commuter-focused applications, while RWD and AWD vehicles might be better suited for specialized, off-road, or heavy-duty tasks.

The key takeaways from this project is that the company should;
-Invest in smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles to reduce fuel consumption and operational costs.
-Optimize vehicle purchases based on drivetrain types for specific fleet needs, with a focus on FWD vehicles for everyday use due to their superior fuel efficiency.
